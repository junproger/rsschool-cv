## About Me

> Greetings! I have a college degree in economics and worked in Internet marketing for a while. Web development interested me as a hobby at the time. But the moment came when I saw more opportunities in a web development. A wise man once told me that: "*a people can to write code — the code can break down the system*". Then I decided to become a web developer and started studying at RS School.
